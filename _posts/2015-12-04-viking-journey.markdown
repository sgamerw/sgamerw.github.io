> 由一款游戏，发掘一个公司

一直都想做一款独立游戏，所以在玩游戏的同时，当发现这款游戏玩法简单，而又不失可玩性的时候就会特别留意。除了留意游戏之外，还会去查看开发人员的其它APP，顺藤摸瓜，希望能发现更多有意思的游戏 :)

在这个过程中，确实也发现很多公司的产品都有共同的特点，以后会慢慢写下我玩过并且留下印象的公司和产品 :)

最近在玩的这款「Viking's Journey」和以前玩过的 [dungelot](http://wzblog.cn/2014/04/02/dungelot/) 是一个公司出的。我就是通过查看开发人员其它APP来挖出来的。果不其然，这款游戏和「dungelot」一样具有非常高的可玩性，说会上瘾也不为过。

这款游戏的玩法和「Threes」,「2048」一脉相承，都是通过上下左右的滑动来合并相同的元素，积累元素个数。在这个基础上又加入了rpg元素，玩家自己就是Ragnar，要到valhalla去，角色会自己向前走，遇到“物体”就会停下来，敌人会对Ragnar发动攻击，宝箱被打开则会赠送道具，绵羊被盾牌挡住就会载着Ragnar向前奔跑，如果没被抵挡住则会随机把网格中的方格变成不可滑动的石块，火堆可以把鸡腿消耗掉回复生命，这时玩家可以进行5次滑动（借助道具或者升级能获得更多次数），之后移除对应元素最多的方格来发动效果。随着路程越走越远，敌人的攻击会更高，开宝箱需要的钥匙会更多，抵挡绵羊需要的盾牌也会更多，所以必须尽量合并相同的元素，能在一个回合中发挥更大的作用。随着各种各样的消耗，最终Ragnar会死在路上，只是时间长短问题，这同样是一命到底的无尽模式，和「dungelot」类似，果然是一家公司开发的:)

在游戏过程中，我有个疑惑，就是这个游戏的数值是怎样控制的？

在旅程中，经常会有奄奄一息的时候，但是很多时候又能化险为夷，满满地格子又被合并到只剩个位数，或者很少的血量刚好碰到火堆，移除了积累上百的鸡腿，原地满血复活，或者被绵羊石化的方格被一个一个解开，每次滑出一片好局面时都会有快感。猜想这样的数值控制应该不仅仅是一个直白的公式，大概有一套规则？给局面评分，在局面不好的时候触发某种规则，能提供一些转机？还没有仔细去思考，但是给我直观的感受是往往山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村！

哦，对了，这家公司是：[Red Winter Software Limited](http://winter.red)

在搜索公司信息的时候，发现了一篇游戏评论，翻译一下。

Lost Viking ($2.99) by Red Winter Software Limited is a puzzle RPG that will keep you busy for hours on end. This particular one is a combination of Threes! with something like Block Legend, sans the match-three part. It’s an interesting combination that may sound weird at first, but it works well together.

When Threes! came out, it became one of my favorite games releases this year. Even though I don’t think of myself as much of a numbers person, I fell in love with the sliding puzzle mechanic that it offered. Soon enough, we started seeing other sliding puzzle games come out, such as 2048, and other hybrids, like Joinz. With the exception of 2048, I picked up all of these sliding puzzle games without hesitation, so when I heard of Lost Viking from Red Winter Software (makers of Dungelot and Dungelot 2), which came out late last week, I knew I had to have it. It combines the sliding puzzle concept in Threes! and combines it with turn-based RPG and endless runner, and I’m finding it to be a fantastic mashup so far.


The art style in Lost Viking is cartoonish, but still beautiful and stunning. The colors in the game are rich and vibrant. The environments in the background look pretty simple, but still have a lot of details that make it gorgeous. The best part of the visuals in this game, though, reside with the characters. Ragnar, your main character, and all of the other zombie vikings you’ll encounter have their unique looks and behaviors, and they’re filled with insane details that bring them to life. The game pieces on the board are fairly basic and colorful, with easily recognizable icons. Animations in the game are smooth, and the adventurous soundtrack is a delight to listen to.

Lost Viking just has one game mode, and at its core, it’s an endless runner type of thing. You set out as Ragnar, who was killed in a war and must now endure the long journey to Valhalla (heaven) on his own, since the goddess was also killed. Along the way, you will encounter many tough foes who need to be slain by your hands, as well as coins and other useful loot to help you in your quest.

Ragnar will move forward on his own, but stops when an enemy shows up or a treasure chest pops up. In order to take action, you will need to match up the tiles in the game board underneath. Just like Threes!, all of the runes will slide in the direction that you swipe your finger (up, down, left, and right). When there are similar runes next to each other, you can combine them into one rune with a larger value. On each turn, you have five “action points” to spend, which allow you to make that many moves. Sometimes you may get lucky and have more than five. Once you are out of action points for that turn, the game takes your highest value rune for attacking (swords) or opening chests (keys). You can also use the meat runes to recover HP, the shield to block ram attacks, and coins to get some extra cash.


The enemies will have more health as you get farther in, so you’ll need to merge as many swords as you can for the most damage. Chests will also require more keys to unlock as you make progress, so I would recommend stockpiling them. The chests contain useful power-up items that you can use to change runes, recover health, block the next attack, and more. However, in the beginning, you’ll only be able to carry three of these artifacts at a time, but the maximum you can have is five.

When Ragnar runs out of health (shown in the top left corner), the game will end and Ragnar will fall into the pit of zombies. Your efforts won’t be in vain, however, as you should get some coins from each run. These coins can be used to purchase upgrades that will make the runs a tad easier in the future. These include luck, stamina, toughness, agility, rage, rune master, improved sack, and more. The game does start off a bit slow, but when you get a few upgrades under your belt, it picks up significantly.

I’m a fan of Red Winter Software’s other games, so I was eager to check out Lost Viking. Since I’m a huge fan of Threes!, RPGs, and endless runners, this is the perfect little game for me. I love the art style and the gameplay, and the game itself is challenging. I’ve been playing this whenever I have a few moments throughout the day, and it’s just a great way to pass the time. I just wish that it was easier to get more gold, because some of those upgrades are quite costly.

I highly recommend checking out Lost Viking if you are in the mood for a fun puzzle RPG game to try this week. You can get Lost Viking in the App Store as a universal download for $2.99, and there are no in-app purchases.
